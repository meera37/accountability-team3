                            Ever noticed how it’s easier to work out when you’ve got a gym buddy? Virtual coworking works the same way. When you’re working alongside others (even if it’s through a screen), you’re less likely to get distracted. By knowing that other people are there to focus, you feel the same pressure to stay productive.

                            Having a virtual coworking buddy or group can create a powerful effect called “body doubling.” Essentially, just by being “with” someone who’s also working, your mind associates their presence with focus. In virtual coworking, accountability becomes the silent motivator.
